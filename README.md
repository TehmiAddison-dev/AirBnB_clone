AirBnB clone
Team project to build a clone of AirBnB

Command interpreter
Our command interpreter looks like a mini shell and allow us manage the objects of our project:
Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
Update attributes of an object
Destroy an object
